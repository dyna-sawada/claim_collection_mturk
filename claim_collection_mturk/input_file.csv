Homework should be abolished.,"We believe that if homework were to be abolished, we could have more free time. As a result, we could do more of what we really wanted like club activities, hobbies, or playing with friends.In my case, I go to tennis club after class until 5:00 pm and then I go to cram school until 8:00 pm. After this full day, I arrive at my home around 8:40 pm to eat dinner and take a shower. At nearly 10:00 pm I start my homework. I have a lot of homework. As a result, I go to belate at night at nearly 1:00 am in the morning and I don’t have the opportunity to sleep for a long period of time. It is not healthy.","They said that homework robs us of our free time.
However,Students have holidays and two long vacations in a year.
They are enough time to do our hobbies or play friends.
We can go trip in a vacation and play friends in holidays.
Also, We can talk with friends at break time in school.
And besides, We may not have such a lot of homework and cram school everyday.
Students have a lot of free time than you think.
At least, they have more free time than adults."
