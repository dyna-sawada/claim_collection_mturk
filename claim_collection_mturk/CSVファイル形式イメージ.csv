In my case, I go to tennis club after class until 5:00 pm and then I go to cram school until 8:00 pm. After this full day, I arrive at my home around 8:40 pm to eat dinner and take a shower. At nearly 10:00 pm I start my homework. I have a lot of homework. As a result, I go to bed late at night at nearly 1:00 am in the morning and I donÅft have the opportunity to sleep for a long period of time. It is not healthy. 
Therefore, homework should be abolished. Thank you."	"We believe that if homework were to be abolished, we could have more free time.
As a result, we could do more of what we really wanted like club activities, hobbies, or playing with friends.
