    <h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
    <p>
      Thank you for taking the time to help us!<br/> In this task, you will be presented with arguments from a series of debates. For the argument, we would like for you to identify claims made by the debater and mark them.
    </p>
    <p>There are 4 steps to do this task.</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Read an original argument which supports the topic such as “Homework should be abolished”.</li>
      <li>Read a counter-argument against original argument.</li>
      <li>Determine claims in the counter-argument and their associated type, referred to as 'Claim Type'.</li>
      <li>Mark the sentences that states claims by selecting sentences and pushing the 'Claim Type' button.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3><strong>What is a claim?</strong></h3>
    <p>
      An argument consists of a <font color="red">claim</font> and a <font color="blue">premise</font>.
      <ul>
        <li> <font color="red">claim</font>: central reason given in support of the debater's stance
        <li> <font color="blue">premise</font>: additional reasons that underpin the plausibility of the claim
      </ul>
      For example, the <font color="red">claim</font> is a red sentence and the <font color="blue">premises</font> are blue sentences in the following argument.

            Hello everyone. Today’s topic is “Homework should be abolished”. We have two points: The first point is “free time” and the second point is “decrease burden on teachers”. I will explain the first point of “free time”.
            <font color="red">We believe that if homework were to be abolished, we could have more free time.</font>
            <font color="blue">As a result, we could do more of what we really wanted like club activities, hobbies, or playing with friends.
            It also makes us healthier because it gives us enough time to sleep.</font>
            Therefore, homework should be abolished. Thank you.

    <h3><strong>Examples</strong></h3>
    <h6><b>Original argument</b></h6>
    <div class="pm-speech mb-3">
      Hello everyone. Today’s topic is “Homework should be abolished”.
      We have two points: The first point is “free time” and the second point is “decrease burden on teachers”.
      I will explain the first point of “free time”.
      We believe that if homework were to be abolished, we could have more free time.
      As a result, we could do more of what we really wanted like club activities, hobbies, or playing with friends.
      In my case, I go to tennis club after class until 5:00 pm and then I go to cram school until 8:00 pm.
      After this full day, I arrive at my home around 8:40 pm to eat dinner and take a shower.
      At nearly 10:00 pm I start my homework.
      I have a lot of homework.
      As a result, I go to bed late at night at nearly 1:00 am in the morning and I don’t have the opportunity to sleep for a long period of time.
      It is not healthy.
      Therefore, homework should be abolished.
      Thank you.

      <span style="background-color:rgba( 223, 51, 78, 0.3 )">Fact</span>: something is true or false<br>

      <span style="background-color:rgba( 248, 203, 51, 0.5 )">Restatement</span>: paraphrase of a original claim<br>
    </div>

    <h6><b>Counter-argument 1</b></h6>
    <div class="pm-speech mb-4">
      They said that students will have more free time by abolishing homework.
      <span style="background-color:rgba( 223, 51, 78, 0.3 )">However, what students will do during free time is just playing games and chatting using SNS in most cases or just sleeping as they said.</span>
      It is because human is lazy in nature.
      Doing hard thing is usually difficult.
      Then, many students will not study at home.
      Of course, some students maybe study what they want to learn, however, the problem is for those kids who can’t study by themselves.
      Imagine, elementary school students, they don’t know what study is important and how to do that.
      <span style="background-color:rgba( 0, 102, 255, 0.25 )">Then, some instructions such as homework is very important.</span>
      Some of you may think homework is worthless, but giving homework meaning giving the opportunity to study is much more meaningful than do nothing or doing addictive games.
      That's why free time by abolishing homework is rather harmful to students.
    </div>

    <h6><b>Counter-argument 2</b></h6>
    <div class="pm-speech mb-3">
      They said that by abolishing homework, we can enjoy more free time.
      <span style="background-color:rgba( 51, 204, 102, 0.3 )">However, it's not true. Even if enjoying free more time is necessary, we can do so by alternative way such as using out time more efficiently.</span>
      Because we can reduce time taken to do homework.
      For example, we can use the break between classes or time before homeroom.
      Moreover, we can do homework with friends during playing with them.
      That's why abolishing homework isn't necessary requirement to create free time.
